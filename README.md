My Personal Site

I will become a full-stack web developer by June 31st 2018. I will try to document my journey here. The main resources I will use to learn will be fcc and udacity. I began udacity's Front end developer nanodegree as a stepping stone to the full-stack web dev nanodegree and am working through the sections. I have been working for 6 days and already finished one section. I am currently working on my personal portfolio. I plan to have it up and running by October 7, 2017.
